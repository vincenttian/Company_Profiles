      <p>One reason the Google investment in 23andMe made sense, was that this company
      could enable the search giant to index another facet of the world&#8217;s information.

      \ title=\"Mark Zuckerberg\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> in February 2004, initially\
      \ as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks,\
      \ half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network.\
      \ Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz\"\

      \ Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks.\
      \ </p>\n\n<p>The original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg&#8217;s\
      \ high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around\
      \ to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for\
      \ the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought\
      \ it to the internet.</p>\n\n<p>With this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and\
      \ Hughes moved out to <a href=\"/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto\" title=\"Palo Alto\"\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\">Palo Alto</a> for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks\
